#Instructions to run the Kanban board
[These](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AZP9sZ1cwZtVTdF_LmDMahL9p-BE9CW4wOOWO8YcslU/edit?usp=sharing) are the instructions for how to find, download, and run my application project for the Gaslight Apprenticeship on Windows. I have noticed as of (around) 6/1/2018 that this Kanban board is no longer linked to on the Apprenticeship info page, and I will be linking to another small project in these instructions as well.
